# High-Performance Parallel Image Filtering and Convolution  
### Real-Time Satellite and Drone Imagery Analysis using OpenMP and CUDA 

---

## üìå Project Overview  
This project explores **high-performance computing (HPC)** techniques for **image filtering and convolution**, focusing on **real-time satellite and drone imagery analysis**.  
We implement and benchmark three approaches:  
1. **Serial C++ Implementation**  
2. **OpenMP (CPU Parallelism)**  
3. **CUDA (GPU Parallelism)**  

The study aims to analyze **speedup, scalability, and performance** across these methods.
